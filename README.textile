h1. My nginx config

Works for my "deploy":http://github.com/lawrencecurtis/deploy/tree/master capistrano+nginx script, will automatically sort out mongrels etc.

h2. Notes

All content lives inside @/srv/@ and vhosts live inside @/srv/vhost.d/*.conf@

Should pretty much get you A everytime on yslow, if you :all you're CSS and JS

h2. Example

See the @examples@ folder for a cakephp and rails vhost example.

I use "spawn-fcgi":http://redmine.lighttpd.net/wiki/lighttpd/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#FastCGI which is part of lighttpd for forwarding php requests.
